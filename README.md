# Battles
Our take on a database on over 600 battles that were fought between 1600 AD and 1973 AD.<br/>
The data is taken from [this post on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/residentmario/database-of-battles). It's programmed in PostgreSQL.

## Historical accuracy
Since this was a project for university, we had to add made-up data to comply with the requirements of the task. I intend to create a historically-accurate version.<br/>
Note: we also had to remove some data that didn't match up.
